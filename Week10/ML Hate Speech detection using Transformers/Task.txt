In this problem, We will take you through a hate speech detection model with Machine Learning and Python.

Hate Speech Detection is generally a task of sentiment classification. So for training, a model that can classify hate speech from a certain piece of text can be achieved by training it on a data that is generally used to classify sentiments. So for the task of hate speech detection model, We will use the Twitter tweets to identify tweets containing  Hate speech.
