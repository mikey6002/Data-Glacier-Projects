Problem Statement:

The large company who is into beverages business in Australia. They sell their products through various super-markets and also engage into heavy promotions throughout the year. Their demand is also influenced by various factors like holiday, seasonality. They needed forecast of each of products at item level every week in weekly buckets. 

 

Challenges:

The time series data showed a range of patterns, some with trends, some seasonal, and some with neither. At the time, they were using their own software, written in-house, but it often produced forecasts that did not seem sensible. Company wanted to explore power of AI/ML based forecasting to replace their in house local solution 

Objective:

1. Build atleast 4-5 multivariate forecasting model which included ML or Deep Learning based Model in PySpark leveraging parallel computing techniques(You can develop models without Pyspark if you are not comfortable with pyspark and parallel computing).
2. Demonstrate best in class forecast accuracy (Forecast Accuracy = 1 - Wt. MAPE where Wt. MAPE = sum(Error)/sum(Actual)
3. Write a code in such a way you run the model in least time
4. Demonstrate explainability in the form of contribution of each variables

 

Note:

Leveage Feature Engineering concepts to derive more variables to gain accuracy improvement
You can build model and demostrate accuracy for Q3-Q4 of 2020
